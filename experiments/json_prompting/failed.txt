The emotions appealed to by an argument are unnecessarily strong for the discussed issue
It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house.
That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.

well, you see people these days are to busy to see what is going on in the world.  I may not know everything, but from I think people are just to stupid to just watch what Bushy (please do not sue me because i just said "Bushy" instead of Bush,I just like the name like that)here is doing. You see, also people are sometimes to poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper(or they're just to lazy too) because of taxes,gas prices,and ALL OF THEIR LITTLE STUPID FRIEND!!!!!!!!
And there is my opinion, you may not like what I just wrote, but DEAL WITH IT!

It's boring. Kind of scary. 
I am not going to complain about the regular sex.
shower time could get right out of hand.
seriously it is a drag. 
Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke, lot's of good looking loonies(I can say that I own that word) in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it.
So each has it's pros and con's but I would have to recommend psyche ward over jail. and jail over my last marriage.


oh for the people that say you lose your self respect, speak for yourselfs. i am just dandy.

By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people.
For example, a family of four would check "education," so their money can go towards their children. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck health care.
This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.

Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV.

I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV.

I feel saying "Gun's don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people".

I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own. 

Change my view.

not even close. owen wilson's kentucky fried accent goes in and out all movie, and the death scene in life aquatic pales to the suicide scene of luke wilson in RT. It helps that needle in the hay is playing. And the funniest 15 seconds of any wes movie (minus future man "you look like a banana" in bottle rocket) is the tennis scene.

We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. 

Get those 80-yr old geysers outa there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.

Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System, that is. 

The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves. 

All incumbents -- OUT!

I like very much the way you started: ALL RISE!
And there is no legal system which is perfect!
Moreover, though, I do not trust "god" and this is due to the fact that god never talks to anyone, except the leaders (which gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by god! - what do you think?)
For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that god ordered them to do that! Last, but not without importance was the Bush claim for America's and her allies to Iraq!

Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.

The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo was an excellent example.  While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured.  The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US.

Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture.  So, if you feed them, it's torture.  If you don't and they starve, it's torture.

Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.

The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever.
The government DOES have that right.
1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states
2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body
3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others
4) a woman cannot use her body to steal
5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public
there are many others. Men can also not do these things.
The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
