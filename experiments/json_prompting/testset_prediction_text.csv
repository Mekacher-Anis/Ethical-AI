It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the ""freedom of religion"" right is not the issue.

The issue is the Establishment Clause: ""Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..."" As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws. 

Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion.

Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do.

However, a petition itself is not an actual ""legal document""...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

Your Friend,

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).
